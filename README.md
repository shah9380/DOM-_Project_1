# UI Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates UI manipulation using JavaScript.

## Styles Used in the Project

In this project, we have applied various style attributes to the target element (in this case, the div with ID "targetDiv") to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Here's an explanation of the style attributes used:

- `background-color`: We set the background color of the div element to yellow to enhance its visual appearance.

- `margin`: A margin of 20 pixels is added to provide spacing around the element.

- `padding`: We applied a padding of 10 pixels to create space between the content and the element's border.

- `font-size`: The font size is set to 18 pixels to ensure readable text.

- `font-weight`: We set the font weight to "bold" for a stronger visual impact.

- `height` and `width`: The height and width of the element are adjusted to 200 pixels and 300 pixels, respectively, to control its size.
